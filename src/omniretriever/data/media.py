"""Lightweight media loaders shared between training and inference.

The loaders intentionally do not import heavy frameworks at module-import time;
all heavy dependencies (``av``, ``librosa``) are imported lazily inside the
function bodies so users who only need text encoding can avoid the cost.

Video decoding moved from ``decord`` to PyAV downstream of the release; see the
note on :func:`load_video_frames`. ``decord`` is no longer imported anywhere.

# librosa cannot read the AAC track inside an MP4 through libsndfile, so it falls

# fallback is the correct path and its output is what every existing embedding was
# built on, so this silences the noise and changes nothing else. Worth doing: on
# Colab every one of those lines is streamed to the browser, and a full run makes
# tens of thousands of them.

# ADDED downstream. A single extraction pass touches the same clip three times,
# once for ``video``, once for ``av`` and once for ``tv``, and decoding is the
# slowest step in the whole pipeline. Memoising the loaders turns that into one
# decode per clip as long as the three calls land close together, which is what
# the record-major batch order in ``omniretriever.cli`` arranges.
#
# The entries are small -- video frames come back already resized, so an 8-frame
# 224 px clip is 1.2 MB, and an 8 s mono waveform at 16 kHz is 512 KB -- so a few
# dozen of them cost tens of megabytes. Callers must not mutate what they get
# back: every hit hands out the same array.

    Note:
        CHANGED downstream. The released code decoded with ``decord``, which
        hangs forever inside its native reader on a large share of this
        benchmark's clips -- 561 of 3515 in a full sweep, concentrated in the
        newest source ids. The hang happens while constructing ``VideoReader``,
        in C, so no Python-side timeout can interrupt it. PyAV reads every one
        of those files (562 of the 567 decord could not handle; the other five
        decode to zero frames under either library and are genuinely broken),
        and it is already a dependency because the audio loader falls back to
        it.

        The two libraries disagree on how many frames a clip holds, because
        decord trusts the container index while this counts frames it actually
        decoded. Uniform sampling spreads its indices over that total, so the
        selected frames -- and every ``video``, ``av`` and ``tv`` embedding --
        differ from a decord-based run. Do not mix embeddings across the two.

        Frames are held at full resolution until the sample is picked, so peak
        memory scales with clip length rather than ``num_frames``. The
        benchmark's p99 clip is 16 s, which is comfortable; very long inputs
        would not be.
